Elm Dashboard
================

This is a sample project to be used in an elm workshop.

It should contain a dashboard containing upcoming events from office365 calendar, and news from our company website.

Building
----------

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used for building, so you'll need gulp-cli installed from npm.

After that just run `npm install` to download packages. 

Use `gulp build` to build the web page. The resulting `index.html` will be in `dist` directory.

You can also use `gulp dev` to use automatic reload on change.
